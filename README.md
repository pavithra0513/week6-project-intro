# Automated Resume Parsing Using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with NLP

## Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a very important task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the goal is to find and categorize entities, namely people, organizations, locations, dates, etc., within texts. Counting entity types in NER provides a foundational element in information retrieval, question-answering systems, and content recommendation engines.

A real-world application of NER can be best shown through the resume parsing domain. Today, organizations receive many resumes daily, which need to be sifted through for the extraction of crucial information to reduce the time required for the recruitment process. NER techniques are used to automatically identify and classify the important key entities from resumes, such as:

- **Personal Information**: Names, contact details  
- **Educational Background**: Degrees, institutions attended  
- **Professional Experience**: Previous job titles, company names  
- **Skills**: Technical proficiencies, languages  

For research and development in this area, the **Resume NER Dataset** has been curated, containing a variety of resumes annotated with **36 different entity categories**. This dataset is of great value for training and evaluating NER models for resume parsing applications. Using this dataset, developers can enhance the accuracy and speed of automated systems, improving talent acquisition workflow processes.
